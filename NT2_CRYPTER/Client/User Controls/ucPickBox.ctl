'       19Nov05 - Added Additional Author Credits to the Header
'               - Added UseDialogColor, UseDialogText, ForeColor, and
'                 BackColor properties to the Control and required code to
'                 allow these routines to work...
'               - Added PrintStatusMsg property to allow the user to specify
'                 what the message should say when the printer returns a value.
'               - Added PrintStaus property to provide the user feedback about
'                 if the Printer dialog "Ok"(1) or "Cancel"(0) button was pressed.
'               - Fixed bug in ShowSave routine which inconssistently computes the
'                 nFileOffset values for a file. We simply set this to "0" and then
'                 extract the values from outside of this of this routine.
'               - Changes Color from Long to OLE_COLOR property to allow for
'                 vb stanard palette.
'               - Added TranslateColor sub to wrap the OleTranslateColor method
'                 for mapping of colors to the current RGB palette.
'       20Nov05 - Added Color RollBack if the value entered is invalid.
'       04Dec05 - Changed the TestHarness layout to make it easier to follow the
'                 flow of the controls and how to use it....
'       06Dec05 - Added MultiFile selection for the ShowOpen routine and fixed several
'                 bugs with the single vs mutiple file selections.
'               - Added a ComboBox to serve at the conatiner and windowing mechanism for
'                 the list and its events....this is a hack, pure and simple. This
'                 approach was selected as it allowes a floating window and list functionality
'                 without the need for building this via API. The combobox is hidden
'                 behind the textbox at runtime and has Visiable = False. Since we
'                 call the droplist window via SendMessage this allows us to have a
'                 floating window like the ComboBox, but none of the overhead to manage ;-D
'               - Add the ability to programmatically Open the MultiFile ComboBox
'                 and check the state of the Droplist.
'               - Added cmdDrop button to simulate the drop button of the ComboBox. The
'                 key feature here being that the button is to the left of the ellipes
'                 button and is resizable with the dialog, unlike the VB ComboBox.
'       13Dec05 - Fixed minor TestHareness bug which displayed the wrong properties when
'                 selecting the lstProperties index.
'       14Dec05 - Fixed single/multiple file open bug in the ShowOpen routine which caused the
'                 the sub to enter into the wrong conditional section when a single file
'                 was selected and the MultiSelect = False.
'               - Fixed PropertyChanged calls for DialogMsg and ToolTipTexts which now supports
'                 individual item settings.
'       15Dec05 - More optimization on the ShowSave and ShowFont routines. These routines now
'                 handle missing extensions and provide a mechanism to enter them. In addtion,
'                 the FontColor property has been added to allow direct color picking of the
'                 font ForeColor, which is not appart of the StdFont structure.
'       16Dec05 - Added Appearance Property and associated API and VB routines to allow for true
'                 3D or Flat appearances of the textbox and buttons.
'       18Dec05 - Fixed Minor bugs in the ShowFont dialog routines which did not preserve the
'                 previous selections by the user. The new addtions resolve all but one known
'                 bug. At the current time, the iPointSize of the FontDialog type structure is
'                 not correctly set via code and the dialog does not respond the changes in this
'                 parameter despite accounting for the size and weight of the font. Verified the
'                 ShowFont code against www.allapi.net example and neither resulted in the pointsize
'                 being selected. For more details see http://mentalis.org/apilist/CHOOSEFONT.shtml
'       25Dec05 - Added Events: DropClick, KeyDown, KeyPress, KeyUp, MouseDown, MouseMove, MouseUp.
'               - Added GetCursorPosition function to allow reporting of the Cursor position via
'                 GetCursorPosition and ScreenToClient API's regardless of which part of the control
'                 the cursor is over. This effectively bypasses the native Event Handlers for each
'                 control, and provides a uniform reporting of the cursor position on the control surface.
'               - Added additional documentation at the Method and Property levels to provide added
'                 clarity of what the functionality is...
'       26Dec05 - Added Filter Property and associated routines to the ShowOpen, ShowSave routines,
'                 see Filter Let property for correct format of the filter string....
'               - Added ProcessFilter to replace string Pipes (|) with vbNullChar and fix the
'                 final size of the passed string to the dialogs.
'               - Added error handling for none initialized Filters to read All Files (*.*)
'       27Dec05 - Added Color, Font, File, and PrinterFlags as Public Enums along with properties
'                 to allow the developer set the styles more easily.
'               - Added SHOWCOLOR_DEFAULT, SHOWFONT_DEFAULT, SHOWOPEN_DEFAULT, SHOWSAVE_DEFAULT,
'                 and SHOWPRINTER_DEFAULT custom Non-Win32 flags to allow for rapid dialog setting
'                 which encompass the most common flags used with this control.
'               - Updated the TestHarness in the UpdatePropertiesDialog to reflect these changes.
'       28Dec05 - Added UseAutoForeColor and associated routines to allow the developer to choose
'                 if the ForeColor is to be selected automatically. The value for the new ForeColor
'                 is based on the XOr of the BackColor and should always produce high contrast text
'                 in the dialog regardless of the color selected.
'       03Jan06 - Added BrowseForFolder functionality and associated routines to round out the collection
'                 based on the request from Richard Mewett.
'       07Mar06 - Added Let Property for Path to pass data to txtResult and m_Path parameter. The displayed
'                 Path is trimmed using the TrimPathLen routine.
'               - Fixed bug which causes the txtResult to display the incorrect message when ucFolder was the
'                 dialog type.
'       16Mar06 - Add Paul Caton's SelfSubclass Thunk code to allow for BrowseForFolder CallBack without the
'                 need for an external bas module. The long point (address) of the z_SubclassProc is held in
'                 in the sc_aSubData(0).nAddrSub provided this is the only item we are subclassing....if we are
'                 subclassing multiple items (i.e. Usercontrol, Parent) then the address for each is stored in
'                 order in the sc_aSubData(n).nAddrSub, where n = 0, 1....n
'       06Jun06 - Added Theme capability and associated routines to allow for XP Themes
'               - Added Theme Properties
'               - Removed Parent subclassing for ThemeChange and SystemColor change messages, because this
'                 caused the IDE to crash on close.
'               - Fixed minor bug in BorderStyle when controls are Flat and change to Theme
'       10Jun06 - Fixed Minor bug in the Refresh routine which did not set the Classic style
'                 correctly if the previous Apearance = Flat
'               - Added LockWindowUpdate to prevent flicker on Picture changes
'       28Jun06 - Fixed TrimPathByLen to be Printer Object independent
'       15Jul06 - Fixed TrackMouse missing Subclaser Code
'       16Jul06 - Fixed Missing IsWinXP routine in GetThemeInfo Method
'       29Jun07 - Fixed bug in ShowSave and ShowOpen dialogs which did not process the default extensions
'               - Added DefaultExt property to allow the developer to set the default extension to
'                 use in the Open/Save Dailogs
'       08Aug07 - Fixed Bug in the BFF section which did not correctly Qualify Paths.
